# **AWS Data Pipeline for Analytics and Visualization**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline leveraging AWS services to perform data ingestion, transformation, querying, and visualization. The goal is to enable efficient data analysis by using scalable and serverless technologies like **Amazon S3**, **AWS Glue**, **Athena**, and **QuickSight**.

## **Workflow**
### **Architecture Overview**
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Data is uploaded and stored in an **Amazon S3** bucket.
   - The dataset consists of order information, including details like `order ID`, `customer name`, `product category`, `profit`, `sales`, etc.
   
2. **Data Cataloging**:
   - An **AWS Glue Crawler** scans the data in the S3 bucket and creates a schema in the Glue **Data Catalog** for efficient querying.

3. **Querying**:
   - **AWS Athena** connects to the Glue Data Catalog and allows querying of the S3 data using SQL.

4. **Visualization**:
   - **Amazon QuickSight** is used to create interactive dashboards and visualizations based on Athena queries.

### **Screenshots**
- **Amazon S3**: Data is stored in structured folders within an S3 bucket.
- **AWS Glue**: Schema and metadata are generated using AWS Glue Crawlers.
- **Athena Queries**: SQL queries on data using Athena.
- **QuickSight Dashboards**: Visualizations showcasing insights such as sales by region, profits by city, and more.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Amazon S3**: Storage for raw and processed data.
- **AWS Glue**: Data ETL and cataloging.
- **AWS Athena**: Serverless querying.
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Business intelligence and visualization.
- **SQL**: Querying language for Athena.
- **AWS IAM**: Secure access and role management.

## **Steps to Reproduce**

### **1. Set Up S3 Bucket**
1. Create an S3 bucket and upload your dataset (e.g., CSV files).
2. Organize files into folders for easier partitioning if needed.

### **2. Configure AWS Glue**
1. Create a Glue Crawler to scan the S3 bucket.
2. Define the data classification (e.g., CSV) and create a database in the Glue Data Catalog.
3. Verify the schema in the Glue Data Catalog.

### **3. Query Data Using Athena**
1. Open **AWS Athena** and select the Glue database.
2. Run SQL queries on the data to analyze key metrics such as total sales, profit by region, etc.
   - Example Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
     FROM orders
     GROUP BY region
     ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
     ```

### **4. Visualize in QuickSight**
1. Connect QuickSight to Athena as a data source.
2. Build visualizations, such as:
   - **Pie Chart**: Profit by city.
   - **Bar Chart**: Sales by product category.
   - **Line Chart**: Sales trends over time.
3. Publish and share the dashboard.

---

## **Sample Queries**
- **Profit by Product Category**:
  ```sql
  SELECT category, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY category
  ORDER BY total_profit DESC;
  ```
- **Top 5 Cities by Sales**:
  ```sql
  SELECT city, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY city
  ORDER BY total_sales DESC
  LIMIT 5;
  ```

---

## **Results**
1. Insights into sales performance by region, city, and category.
2. Improved data accessibility and analysis using Athena and QuickSight.
3. Automation of data processing with AWS Glue.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Automate data ingestion with **AWS Lambda**.
- Implement machine learning for sales forecasting using **Amazon SageMaker**.
- Set up real-time data updates for dashboards.
